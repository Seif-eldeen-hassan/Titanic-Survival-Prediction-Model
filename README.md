A comprehensive binary classification project to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. This notebook covers the entire Data Science pipeline: from raw data exploration to advanced feature engineering and model optimization.

## Objective
The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features like age, gender, social class, and family size.

##  Tech Stack
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn

##  Project Pipeline

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed survival rates based on **Sex** (Female survival rate was significantly higher).
- Investigated the impact of **Pclass** on survival.
- Visualized age distribution and its correlation with survival.

### 2. Feature Engineering & Cleaning
- **Handling Missing Values:** Imputed missing values for `Age`, `Embarked`, and handled the `Cabin` column.
- **Feature Creation:** - Extracted **Titles** (Mr, Mrs, Miss, etc.) from names.
    - Created **FamilySize** by combining `SibSp` and `Parch`.
    - Developed an **IsAlone** feature.
- **Encoding:** Converted categorical variables into numerical format using One-Hot Encoding/Label Encoding.

### 3. Model & Evaluation
The project utilizes a **Random Forest Classifier**, tuned to handle the nonlinear relationships in the data.

**Results:**
- **Accuracy:** 0.78 F-Score .
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Confusion Matrix, Precision, F-Score and Recall.


##  Key Insights
- **Gender** was the strongest predictor of survival.
- Passengers in **First Class (Pclass 1)** had a much higher chance of survival.
- Smaller families had better survival rates compared to individuals traveling alone or with very large families.
